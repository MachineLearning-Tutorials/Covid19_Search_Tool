# Covid19_Search_Tool
Resources for working with CORD19 NLP dataset

# Plan of action
- Topic modeling with LDA @Rachael Creager 
- NLU feature engineering with TF-IDF (then BERT after that works) @Maryana Alegro 
- Feature engineering with metadata
- Making an embedding search space via concatenating the TOPIC, NLU and metadata vectors. 
- Then Creating a cosine sim search engine that creates the same datatype as the above vector
- Streamlit app that has search bar, and a way to visualize article information
